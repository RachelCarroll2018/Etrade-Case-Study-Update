# Etrade Case Study

Name of company: 
* E*Trade

 When was the company incorporated? 
 * 1991

Who are the founders of the company? 
* Bernard Newcomb & William Porter

How did the idea for the company (or project) come about? 
* They developed this company to use as a process to trade online for investors. It ended up being the first online transaction ever sent to an exchange and completely changed how all investors controlled their portfolios. They no longer needed a person to invest.

How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
* The company was originally funded several hundreds of thousands of startup capital from TradePlus (a company created by Bernard and William previously in 1982)




## Business Activities:

What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve? 
* It’s a platform that doesn’t require you to have a significant background or education in finance or investing. They provide extensive educational tools on their mobile apps so passive investors can easily understand what it is they’re investing in. They offer two different apps for people that have different goals in investing. They also provide extensive charting tools so an investor can automatically see charts with an in depth analysis of the stock so they can understand what the potential future of that stock would look like. The robo-advisor aspect is built to maintain your portfolio and keep you on pace for your future goals.

Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers? 
* Etrade is actually built to market to all users, whether they are beginner, intermediate, or expert. They have two mobile apps, the first is more focused towards the beginner/intermediate and the Power ETrade platform is dedicated to more advanced investors. They do NOT trade in cryptocurrencies at this time, so that removes a large market in 2022 of people wanting to learn and get into crypto. They offer ways to “gain indirect exposure to popular cryptocurrencies via securities and futures”

* They have amassed 5.2 million customer accounts with $360 billion in assets.

What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?) (Used Robinhood as a competitor)

* E Trade has more assets and markets available
Example) Mutual funds, futures, fixed income, and OTC markets 

* E Trade has a mobile app specifically designed for more advanced users, where as Robinhood has just the one app and is mostly built for beginners
* E Trade has more analytical tools, calculators, and most importantly: educational content
I would think that the unfair advantage that they use is experience, they have been in the industry for 40+ plus years and have a hold on such a large market of beginners and advanced investors whereas Robinhood just started in 2013. Robinhood is extremely popular, however it’s newer and is limited in capabilities.
E Trade also provides actual customer service when needed, whereas Robinhood conversations are all conducted electronically.

Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them?

* They use a lot of Javascript based frameworks, Adobe, Jave, Bootstrap, Apache, Angular
* They also use analytics traking with Dynatrace, Adobe Analytics, Heap, Linkedin Insight
* They also do some advertising on Reddit and Twitter

## Landscape:

What domain of the financial industry is the company in?
* Robo-advising

What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years? 
* In the last decade, robo-advising has grown to manage $460 billion dollars from 2010 - 2020. A large component in the 30% increase of roboadvising from 2019 to 2020 was the increase in desire for investing from millenials and Gez Z'ers. "Millenials are twice as likely to as likely as baby boomers to consider using a robo advisor for investments" [Cited](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/12/why-robo-advisors-may-never-replace-human-financial-advisors.html)
* Companies are now offering a *hybrid* service that combines the human element of customer service and care with digital advice. Some examples include Vanguard and Betterment.
* Younger generations are accruing more disposable wealth and as stated above are more tech forward, so the market is expected to grow to $1.2 trillion by 2024.
* Education in investing has become commonplace within robo advising so that beginners are able to better understand what it is they're investing in.

What are the other major companies in this domain?
* Vanguard, Schwab, Betterment, Wealthfront, Blooom, Acorns, etc.


## Results

What has been the business impact of this company so far?
* Not only did they competely reinvent how investors could make trades they also have spent substantial amount of funds investing in smaller businesses and startups. They've invested over $178 million in Series A - C companies.
* ETrade has also acquired multiple companies along the way including Trust Company of America, OptionsHouse, Harrisdirect, and more. In purchasing these companies their user base grew substantially and made them a larger competitor in the market.
* They changed the dynamic of investing for people who are younger, or less wealthy to make an impact on their investment portfolios with little to no commissions.

What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?
1) How many users download and then actually use your services
2) How many people continue to use the services on a monthly or yearly basis vs just a one time transaction
3) Monthly, quarterly, and annual revenue
4) Marketing effectiveness and cost
5) Customer satisfaction
6) Rate of Return

* Etrade had a 22%+ growth from 2016 to 2018 increasing their revenue from $1.42B to $2.87B but plateaued in 2019 to a small increase of only .45% and then -.59% in 2020. Etrade was purchased by Morgan Stanley in 2020 so it makes sense that revenue slowed down due to such a large change and potential increase in expenses. 
* Etrade had a large dip in May - July 2019 losing almost 400,000 users but that was short lived as they jumped back up to 700,00+ users in September 2019 and have trended mostly positive. The last update was in July 2021 when they had 1.01 million users. 
* I find it pretty interesting that given such a large increase in investment users, specifically Millenials and Gen Z'ers, that they didn't see a sharper increase in users. I suppose they all went to Robinhood instead!

 How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

 * This small sample size shows them performing in range or better than the companies listed below. However, Robinhood as completely disrupted and changed the market for robo advising, specifically for the younger generation and it's argued their app is easier to navigate through. I think as a result of social media and verbal recommendations, a lot of newer users gravitate towards robinhood.

## Recommendations

If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
* Allow for cryptocurrency trading, the two companies in the photos provided above had the largest increase in user activity and they both provide crypto trading. Honestly, as a normal 28 year old adult, I never think of ETrade as a company, I know of Robinhood and WeBull, so I think an updated marketing strategy better dedicated to younger adults could help revitalize their user growth even further. Their social media platform is really poor, they have **67** users on tiktok - if you wanted a way to connect with the younger generation, that is a great way to market in quick and free videos.

Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
* Cryptocurrency overall has grown 187.5% in 2021, so it's a powerful way to introduce new financial pathways to the company.

* Tiktok and Social Media platforms are the norm nowadays for larger companies, there are brands like Duolingo, who has amassed a 3.3 million user following, Chipotle has 1.7 million followers, etc. Social media strategists have found a way to connect with users that's actually funny and can be informative as well. 

What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
* Social Media -mainly TikTok, but also Facebook and Instagram 
* I believe either they'd have to rebuild their software to include cryptocurrency or outsource through a third party vender to assist in the transactions which would charge a fee each time it was utilized. There are third party vendors like Ledger Vault, Coinbase, and Blockfi that they could potentially use. 

Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
* Adopting cryptocurrency could open the door to a much larger user base and increase revenue by increasing trading.
* Increasing marketing and social media presence can also increase users, downloads, searches, and more. Peopel are becoming more and more focused on atypical job roles and wanted to have passive income. The hashtags #entrepreneur has 12.8 billion views, #sidehustle has 6.8 billion views, etc.
